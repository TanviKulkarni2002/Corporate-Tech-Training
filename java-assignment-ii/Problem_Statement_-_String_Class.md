Assignment 2 - String Search and Replace:

- Write a Java method that takes a paragraph of text and searches for all occurrences of a specific word or phrase. Replace this word or phrase with another word provided by the user.
- Ensure that your method is case-insensitive, meaning it should find and replace words regardless of their case (e.g., "Java" should match "java", "JAVA", etc.).
