Important Pointers:

1. Before running the code, run the SQL commands mentioned in the MySQL_Scripts.txt file in WorkBench or CLI.
2. If you change the name of the database, modify your SQL commands for the same.
3. Enter your MySQL username and password in the LeagueRepository.java file.
4. Use the correct URL to your database and modify the current one, as necesaary in the LeagueRepository.java file.
5. Ensure that the name of the table is 'league' only. Do not use other names to avoid refactoring the whole code.
6. Truncate table query needs to be run each time in mysql Workbench or CLI after running the program (LeagueClient.java) once, because leagueId has been made primary key.
