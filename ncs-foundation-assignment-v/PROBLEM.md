# Assignment Step Description

Read the given set of questions and solve them by writing SQL queries

** Things to do **
* Clone the boilerplate
* Create sql queries based on the problem statement and expected solution
* Write all queries in the txt file in Sequence.
* Add that to the boilerplate that you have cloned and push it to gitlab 
  ( Note: You should have a new repo created in gitlab where it has to be pushed)

## Problem Statement
Note management app (similar to Google Keep) is used to take notes, add notes into categories and set reminders for a note. Create the necessary DB schema including tables, relationships and add sample data into each table.

### Expected Solution
* Create the tables for Note, Category, Reminder, User, NoteReminder and NoteCategory.
* User table fields: user_id, user_name, user_added_date, user_password, user_mobile
* Note table fields: note_id, note_title, note_content, note_status, note_creation_date
* Category table fields : category_id, category_name, category_descr, category_creation_date, category_creator
* Reminder table fields : reminder_id, reminder_name, reminder_descr, reminder_type, reminder_creation_date, reminder_creator

Insert the rows into the created tables (Note, Category, Reminder, User, NoteReminder and NoteCategory) as per attached snapshot(Data_Snapshot.docx).

Write the queries to carry out the below listed operations:

1.	Fetch the row from User table with Id=112233 and Password=’Maya1214’.
2.	Fetch all the rows from Note table with note_creation_date=’01/31/2019’.
3.	Fetch all the Categories created after ‘01/22/2019’.
4.	Fetch all category details which belongs to note with note id=1.
5.	Fetch all the Notes from the Note table with userId=112244.
6.	Fetch all the Notes from the Note table for category_id=1.
7.	Fetch all the reminder details for note id=2.
8.	Write a query to change the note_status to ‘Completed’ with note Id=3.
9.	Write a query to set a reminder of type ‘Personal Reminders’ for Note with note id=1. [Find reminder id based upon reminder_type]
10.	Write a query to detach all reminders from Note with note_id=2.

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-rdbms** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab.stackroute.in/ncs-foundation-assignments/ncs-foundation-assignment-v.git assignment-solution-rdbms`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-rdbms folder

    `cd assignment-solution-rdbms`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote remove origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-rdbms` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-rdbms.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

56. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

7. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
8. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

9. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed

### Important instructions for Participants
> - We expect you to write the assignment on your own by following through the guidelines, learning plan, and the practice exercises
> - The code must not be plagirized, the mentors will randomly pick the submissions and may ask you to explain the solution
> - The code must be properly indented, code structure maintained as per the boilerplate and properly commented
> - Follow through the problem statement shared with you
